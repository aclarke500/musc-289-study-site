    <h1>Week 8: South Asia</h1>
    <h2>Demonstration of Raga (Rag Yaman: Alap and Gat in Tintal)</h2>
    <p>In the context of South Asian music, the raga serves as a foundational musical framework that guides the performance of melody.

Following the Alap, the Gat section introduces the Tintal rhythm cycle, marked by a fixed composition and improvisational exchanges between the soloist and the tabla player. This structure embodies the blend of improvisation and composition that is central to North Indian classical music, illustrating how the raga framework can generate both freedom and order within a performance.</p>
